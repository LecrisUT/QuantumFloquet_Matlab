  type: method
  name: QuanFloq.baseFloquet.Ebar
  class: QuanFloq.baseFloquet
  purpose: Calculate the average energies
  description: |-
    Calculates either the effective or exact average energies of specific states
  syntax:
    nameValue: true
    groups:
      - syntax:
          - inputs:
              - Psi
            outputs:
              - Ebar
            description: |-
              Calculate the exact average energies
      - syntax:
          - inputs:
              - Psi
              - effective=true
            outputs:
              - eEbar
            description: |-
              Calculate the effective average energies
  inputs:
    Psi:
      purpose: Wave functions
      kind: required
      class: double
      dims: [ 2, 3 ]
      description: |-
        Either in Floquet or Fourier representation. Multiple states can be passed in the second dimension.
  outputs:
    Ebar:
      purpose: Exact average energy
      symbol: \bar{E}
      kind: required
      dims: 1
      class: double
      description: |-
        Each average energy corresponds to the states in the second dimension of |Psi|
    eEbar:
      purpose: Effective average energy
      symbol: \bar{\mathcal{E}}
      kind: required
      dims: 1
      class: double
      description: |-
        Triggered by |effective|. Each average energy corresponds to the states in the second dimension of |Psi|
  nameValue:
    effective:
      purpose: Effective or exact average energy
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: logical
      default: false
      description: |-
        If set to true, will calculate effective average energy instead of the exact one
    normalize:
      purpose: Normalize the wavefunctions before calculating
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: logical
      default: false
      description: |-
        If set to true, will first normalize the wave functions before calculating the average energy.
        In the case of exact average energies, the wave functions are always normalized when calculating |HBar|,
        but not when calculating the expectation values
