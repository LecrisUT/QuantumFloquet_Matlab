              Evaluate the physical wave function at time |t|
  inputs:
    Psi:
      purpose: Floquet wave functions
      kind: optional
      dims: [ 2, 3 ]
      class: double
      description: |-
        In either Floquet or Fourier representation. If |eps| is also passed, these have to be quasi-energy eigenstates.
  outputs:
    Phit:
      purpose: Floquet wave functions at time $t$
      kind: required
      dims: 2
      class: double
      description: |-
        In Floquet representation. If |iterator| is passed, each step in the adiabatic continuation is represented by the third dimension
    Psit:
      purpose: Physical wave functions at time $t$
      kind: required
      dims: 2
      class: double
      description: |-
        Includes the quasi-energy oscillation. Floquet states |Psi| are presumed to be quasi-energy eigenstates
  nameValue:
    eps:
      purpose: Quasi-energy eigenstates
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 1
      class: double
      type:
        - real
      description: |-
        If passed, will evaluate the physical wave functions at time $t$=|t| instead of the Floquet ones
