    Psi:
      purpose: Floquet eigenstate
      kind: optional
      dims: [ 2, 3 ]
      class: double
      description: |-
        In Floquet representation. If |iterator| is passed, each step in the adiabatic continuation is represented by the third dimension
    eps:
      purpose: Quasi-energy eigenvalue
      kind: optional
      dims: [ 1, 2 ]
      class: double
      type:
        - real
      description: |-
        If |iterator| is passed, each step in the adiabatic continuation is represented by the second dimension
    Ebar:
      purpose: Average energy eigenvalue
      kind: optional
      dims: [ 1, 2 ]
      class: double
      type:
        - real
      description: |-
        If |iterator| is passed, each step in the adiabatic continuation is represented by the second dimension
  nameValue:
    iterator:
      purpose: Adiabatic path
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: QuanFloq.baseCalcIterator
      description: |-
        Iterator that updates the object's parameter on an adiabatic path
    Print:
      purpose: Print progress for adiabatic continuation
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: logical
      default: true
      description: |-
        If iterator object is passed, will toggle printing the progress of the eigenstate calculation, otherwise has no 
        effect
    eps0:
      purpose: Quasi-energy Brillouin zone center
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: double
      type:
        - real
      description: |-
        If this is passed, will center the quasi-energy eigenvalues around it. If |iterator| is also passed, this only 
        affects the initial value. If it is not defined, the eigenstates are centered around their energy spectra
    Psi_prev:
      purpose: Wave functions to adiabatically continue with
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 2
      class: double
      description: |-
        Can either be wave functions in Floquet representation or static ones. If |iterator| is also passed, it defines 
        the initial state. Internally set by |iterator|
    eps_prev:
      purpose: Quasi-energies to adiabatically continue with
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 1
      class: double
      type:
        - real
      description: |-
        If defined, will shift each state's brillouin zone to adiabatically continue the quasi-energies, otherwise the
        states are in the representation defined by |eps0|. Internally set by |iterator|
