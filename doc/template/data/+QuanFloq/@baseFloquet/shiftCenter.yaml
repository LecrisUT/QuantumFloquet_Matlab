    filter:
      purpose: Filter equivalent wave functions
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: logical
      default: true
      description: |-
        If set, will filter the wave functions that represent the same state
    tol:
      purpose: Overlap tolerance
      kind: namevalue
      dims: 0
      class: logical
      default: 1E-6
      description: |-
        If filter is set, this defines the overlap tolerance up to which two states are considered equivalent
